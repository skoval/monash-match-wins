# WHO WILL WIN?: Predicting match results in professional tennis?

Predicting 'who will win?' is the holy grail of sports analytics. One of the main challenges for prediction models in tennis is the sparsity of head-to-heads, that is, many in tennis believe that some players don't match-up well, but many players don't meet frequently enough to estimate match-up effects with great certainty.

The goal of this project is to develop a prediction model for tennis match results that accounts for head-to-head effects.

## Sponsoring Organization

##  DATA

The dataset for the project will include men's and women's professional tennis match results from 2011-2021. In addition to the names and ids of the winning and losing player of each match, the dataset will include the date, surface, event name, and round for the match played. A sample of the structure is provided under `data`. The full datasets will be provided to the intern at the start of the course.

## PROJECT GOALS

The main objective of the project is to develop and evaluate different approaches for predicting the win/loss results of tennis matches at the pro level. Another key goal is accounting for head-to-head effects. The 'head-to-head' refers to the concept that some player matchups are not explained by talent alone, that is, some players appear to do better (or worse) against specific opponents, even considering the skill-level of each player. The project should investigate strategies for estimating and incorporating these matchup effects into a prediction model.
